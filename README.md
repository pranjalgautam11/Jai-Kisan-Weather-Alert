# Weather Alert Application

The **Weather Alert Application** is a web-based tool designed to keep farmers informed about upcoming weather conditions. By providing timely alerts and updates, this application helps farmers make informed decisions. The app features separate roles for farmers (end-users) and admins (users who manage alerts and maintain user information).

## Introduction

The Weather Alert Application enables farmers to access real-time and weekly weather forecasts, severe weather alerts, and weather trend visualizations. Admins can customize alert thresholds and manage user information, enhancing the app’s responsiveness to farmers' needs.

## Features

1. **User Registration and Login**
   - Separate login pages for farmers and admins, each redirected to their respective dashboards upon login.
   - Farmers can register through a signup form with details like name, email, contact, and location.

2. **Home Page (For Farmers)**
   - Input field for city name to fetch weather data.
   - Displays current weather conditions and a weekly forecast, including temperature, humidity, precipitation, and wind speed.
   - Severe weather alerts are provided through pop-ups to help farmers prepare for extreme events.

3. **Admin Dashboard and Weather Alert System**
   - Automated alerts based on external weather API data for conditions like storms and extreme heat.
   - Admins can set customizable thresholds to control when alerts are triggered.

4. **Weather Forecast Visualization**
   - Weather data is presented visually with charts showing temperature, humidity, and precipitation trends, aiding farmers in tracking weather patterns.

5. **Backend API**
   - Integrated with a third-party weather API for real-time and forecasted weather data based on location.
   - RESTful APIs for alert management, user data access, and profile updates.
   - Secure API endpoints accessible only to authorized users.

6. **Error Handling and Notifications**
   - Input validation and API error handling ensure a smooth user experience.
   - Custom error pages guide users in case of issues.

7. **Database Design and Data Persistence**
   - MongoDB stores user profiles and weather alert logs for admin access and data tracking.
   - Sensitive information is encrypted for data security.

8. **Mobile Responsiveness**
   - Responsive UI design ensures usability across devices, with layouts tailored for farmers and admins on mobile.

## Technical Requirements

### Frontend Tech Stack

- **HTML**: Structures web pages, form fields, buttons, and sections.
- **CSS**: Styles the user interface, handling layout, colors, fonts, and responsive design.
- **JavaScript**: Manages interactivity, form validation, and real-time data updates.
- **Bootstrap**: A CSS framework providing a clean, organized layout, with components like navigation bars, forms, and cards.
- **AJAX**: Enables asynchronous communication between the client and server to fetch weather data without full-page reloads.

### Backend Tech Stack

- **Node.js**: Used as the server-side runtime environment, ideal for handling multiple requests and real-time data.
- **Express.js**: A flexible Node.js framework for defining routes, middleware, and handling HTTP requests/responses.
- **MongoDB**: A NoSQL database for storing user data and weather alert logs.
- **Weather API Integration**: Fetches real-time weather data from a third-party API (e.g., OpenWeatherMap) for display and alert purposes.

## Future Enhancements

1. **SMS/Email Alerts**: Offer SMS or email notifications alongside in-app alerts.
2. **Multilingual Support**: Provide language options to cater to farmers from diverse linguistic backgrounds.
3. **Advanced Weather Predictions**: Use machine learning for more accurate, location-based predictions.
4. **Offline Mode**: Allow offline access to previously fetched weather data.
5. **Feedback Mechanism**: Add a feedback form for farmers to improve app usability and alert accuracy.
